"""Unitree Go2 keyboard teleop via WebRTC with Rage Mode enabled.

Same topology as unitree-go2-webrtc-keyboard-teleop (GO2Connection +
ControlCoordinator with transport_lcm adapter), but GO2Connection is
configured with rage_mode=True so FsmRageMode is toggled on after
BalanceStand at connection start. Velocity commands flow through the
existing WIRELESS_CONTROLLER joystick channel (driven by Twist → move()),
which Rage's policy consumes directly — no separate publisher thread
needed because the WebRTC connection already owns that channel.

Use this when you want Rage's ~2.5 m/s envelope but don't want to run
the direct-DDS adapter (e.g. because you're driving from a laptop that
isn't on the Go2's DDS LAN, or because onboard NUC power constraints
rule out the direct path). See data/notes/go2_firmware_modes.md.

Usage:
    dimos run unitree-go2-webrtc-rage-keyboard-teleop
