"""Compatibility Unitree G1 blueprint exports.

This module restores the public blueprint names referenced by
``dimos.robot.all_blueprints``. The modular blueprint package referenced in
review comments is not present in this workspace, so these exports map the
legacy names to the currently available modules.
